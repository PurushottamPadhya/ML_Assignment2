Created by : Purushottam Padhya (s3847501),  Shitiz Garg (s3791123) 

This file contains the details of the submission of assignment 2 and how to run the assignment2.ipynb file. 
We used google Colab to accomplish the assignment task, Google Colab is a hosted Jupiter notebook services which required no additional tools with free to use and provided by the Google.

To run the provided code the following steps need to follow to run the code in google collar.


1. Using google collab

Step 1: Go to your google drive and if you have not added google colaboratory already in your drive add the colaboratory app by right clicking on your drive and add additional app named colaboratory.

Step 2:
Create folder named, ML_Assignment2 and add upload data.zip file into this folder.

Step 3: After installing google Colab it will show the folder named Colab Notebooks, where you have to upload the provided notebook file named assignment2.ipynb

Step 4: Then you have to open the notebook file which will run the notebook environment and you have to connect the notebook and after successful connection the status should show connect.

Step 5: You have to run the code from first cell. 

Step 6: After package import cell in 4-5 cell number next to the Colab request you to access your google drive to access the file. There you have to click the link and allow for access with your provided drive email and enter the given code in that cell will authorize to access your drive data. 

Step 7: Then after you can run and test the any cell or overall solution of the assignment.



2. Using Anaconda Notebook,

Step 1: Need to install all the Tensorflow and Keras library into your anaconda environment. 

Step 2: Extract the data.zip file into a data folder the python notebook file into the same directory as data folder. 

Step 3: Open the python notebook file, it should be executable now. 


Notes: 

Since we used Google Colab for developing this assignment, we could not upload the assignment2.ipynb file in GitHub as to upload GitHub every time we have to download the code and upload in GitHub make difficult to synchronise with us two so we uploaded at the end and at the beginning only.  as we both are working together in a google colab with equal contribution on the assignment.
